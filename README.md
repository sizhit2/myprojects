**Introduction**

This is a final project code for Text Information Retrieval. It is a movie search engine. It use Flask framework in backend, Bootstrap4 in frontend, TF-IDF algorithms in building search enginee and recommendation systems, and scraper to scrape movie reviews in Rotten tomato.

**Summary**

Data folder includes movie.csv, a combined movie data file includes data scraped from rotten tomato.

Static folder includes necessary CSS files.

Template folder includes html files.

application.py is the file to drive flask to run the website in the local host.

corpus_generator.ipynb. is broken, and cannot be open. My guess is that it includes code to train the whole movie.csv and output model.pkl and model_recommend.pkl.

demo.ipynb contains code to try TF-IDF weighting, but it is hard to go over each line of code.

imdb_scraper.ipynb includes code to scrape the information from Rotten Tomato.

preprocessing.ipynb includes code to combine the data files into one csv file.

cs410 project documentation contains a detailed description of implementation of this project.

**Suggestion**

A better example of training TF-IDF weighting is inside Chatbot Technmical Implementation Guide.
